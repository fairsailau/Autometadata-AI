# Streamlit Page Configuration Fix

## Issue Description

The Autometadata-AI application was encountering a `StreamlitSetPageConfigMustBeFirstCommandError` when deployed to Streamlit Cloud. This error occurs when `st.set_page_config()` is not the first Streamlit command in the application.

In the original code, the session state was being initialized before setting the page configuration:

```python
# Initialize session state
initialize_session_state()

# Set page config
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Box Metadata Extraction",
    page_icon="ðŸ“¦",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
```

This violates Streamlit's requirement that `st.set_page_config()` must be the first Streamlit command after importing the Streamlit library.

## Solution Implemented

The fix involved reordering the code to ensure that `st.set_page_config()` is called before any other Streamlit operations:

```python
# Set page config - MUST be the first Streamlit command
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Box Metadata Extraction",
    page_icon="ðŸ“¦",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)

# Initialize session state
initialize_session_state()
```

A comment was added to make it clear that this must be the first Streamlit command to prevent future issues.

## Why This Works

Streamlit requires that page configuration be set before any other Streamlit commands are executed. This is because page configuration affects the entire Streamlit application layout and must be established before any content is rendered.

When `st.set_page_config()` is called after other Streamlit commands, Streamlit raises an error because it cannot change the page configuration after content has started rendering.

## Best Practices for Streamlit Applications

1. Always place `st.set_page_config()` immediately after importing Streamlit
2. Make sure no other Streamlit commands (like `st.session_state` access) occur before page configuration
3. Import other modules and initialize variables after setting page configuration
4. Add a comment to remind developers that page configuration must be first
